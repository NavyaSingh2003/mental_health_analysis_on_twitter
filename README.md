MENTAL HEALTH ANALYSIS ON TWITTER -> every single analysis is present in Twitter_Analytics.ipynb, Twitter_Models.ipynb along with its Output
1) Overall Description of the Project
In the contemporary landscape of social media, where conversations unfold at a rapid pace, understanding the dynamics of mental health discourse has become an imperative task. The prevalence of discussions related to mental health on platforms like Twitter, Reddit serves as both an opportunity and a challenge. The problem at hand revolves around the need to decipher, analyze, and comprehend the intricate layers of user interactions and expressions concerning mental health. This multifaceted exploration is situated at the intersection of computer science and education, driven by the conviction that leveraging data science can offer profound insights into the digital landscape of mental well-being

3) Solution Approach
   
I.	Data Pre-processing

My journey commenced with data pre-processing, the cornerstone of my entire analysis. It aims to analyze social media posts employing NLP pre-processing. I undertook a meticulous process to refine the dataset, stripping away noise and ensuring the purity of my textual corpus. This module included the removal of mentions, a crucial step to enhance the focus on the core content of users' expressions. The cleanliness of the dataset set the stage for subsequent in-depth analyses.

II.	Temporal Analysis
The temporal analysis module unfolded as a captivating exploration into the temporal nuances of mental health discourse. I scrutinized the ephemerality of emotions, identifying peak activity periods and uncovering the subtle fluctuations in sentiment over days, weeks, and months. This module not only added a temporal dimension to our understanding but also provided insights into the dynamic nature of online discourse.

III.	Social Network Analysis
Diving into the social fabric of Twitter, the analysis extended to the friendships and connections within the platform. Within this module, I meticulously explored the social networks of both depressed and non-depressed users. Unraveling patterns within the label 0 (non-depressed) and label 1 (depressed) social circles, this analysis sheds light on the interconnectedness of individuals and the potential influence of emotional support networks on digital well-being.

IV.	Topic Modelling with LDA and Word2Vec
The module of topic modeling helps in my exploration, allowing me to discern the latent themes within textual conversations. Leveraging Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Word2Vec, I embarked on a journey to uncover the underlying topics discussed by users. This intricate dance with language allowed me not only to categorize users but also to unveil the nuanced triggers and topics that permeate mental health discourse.

V.	Transition from WhatsApp to Twitter
My project's evolutionary journey, initially rooted in a sentiment analysis exploration within WhatsApp, led to a transformative shift to the expansive landscape of Twitter. The limitations encountered within the WhatsApp ecosystem, including a lack of diverse conversations and limited features, spurred our transition. This strategic move enabled me to not only overcome shortcomings but also to harness the vast reservoir of data and diverse conversations that Twitter offers.

VI.	Analyzing Triggers and Topics of Interest: Unmasking Hashtag Dynamics
Within this module, I meticulously dissected the textual landscape, scrutinizing hashtags of paramount interestâ€”#anxiety, #abuse, #depression, and more. The analysis not only provided insights into the prevalent triggers but also offered a nuanced understanding of the topics that resonate most profoundly within the online mental health community.

VII.	Month-Wise Self-Confessions: Navigating the Cycles of Introspection
This granular exploration unfolded as a poetic examination of self-expression, month by month. The analysis journeyed through the temporal evolution of personal revelations, offering poignant insights into the cyclical nature of self-confessions within the online community. Month-wise analysis became a narrative tool, revealing the rhythm and flow of introspection on Twitter.

VIII.	Conclusion
Each module contributes to my collective understanding of the digital landscape where vulnerability meets resilience. My approach is not just a technical endeavor; it is a testament to the power of interdisciplinary exploration, blending data science with empathy to navigate the complexities of human expression in the digital age.
